Once upon a time, there was a farmer.

He lived his life farming his field inherited from the generation of his great grandfathers, along with his wife and children, he lived a penniless yet contented life.

One day, while he was out farming his potatoes and carrots, a lightning strikes from his village, from there a massive number of monsters spawned and wreck havoc and destroyed the whole village, burning it to ash leaving a barren land.

He immediately gets his sickle and sprints to go home and check his family.

After a long, exhausting run he reach his house, only to see that the monsters had already killed its wife and child.

Seeing this he lose hopes, but gaining too much rage he would hurt anyone until they are down.

"Who sent you to this village?" He asked the monsters.
"Its none of your business" said the humanoid pig, mocking the farmer.
"I'm going to kill all of you." said the farmer furiously.
"What could a lowly peasant like you can do?" the monster ask, then a deafening laughter will be heared from the area.

"Just wait and see what a peasant like me can do.". he grabs his sickle and charge towards the monster.
"Omae wa mou shindeiru" he said while smiling menacingly.

In just a moment, he slashed through the whole monster squad killng half of them, but leaving him a large wound from the battle.

"Not bad for a weak farmer, but this is the end, you'll die."

cannot move, he endure the pain caused by his injuries, he see once again the dead bodies of his wife and child.
he muttered to himself. "I'll bring justice to both of you.." 

a head came flying in the air after a second.

```A year later.```
